# Questgen AI

* Questgen AI is focused on generating Question generation algorithms using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing algorithms. Questgen provides easy to use tools to make questions.
* Currently we are focused on generating questions which are gramitically correct and sound in nature using text-to-text transformers.
* We for ease of use generated all types of questions using a single pretrained transformer model.(T5-text-to-text Transformer)
* Rather than generating random question we focus our model to create specific types of questions for specific purpose.
eg. <br>
-- General Questions : (What,Where,Who,how,When etc) <br>
-- Boolean Questions : (Is,Did,Does etc) Output is expected either True/False <br>
-- Paraphrase Questions : (Generate similar but different questions of a given question) <br>
-- MCQ Questions : Generate Questions with answers and similar options.
